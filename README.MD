https://harry.ml - Source Code

## How to use
1. `git clone https://github.com/HarryUK/harry-ml-source` or download and extract the zip file
2. `cd THE/DIRECTORY/WHERE/YOU/DOWNLOADED/` so in example: `cd /home/harry/harry-ml-source/`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Finally run `npm run build:serve` and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080

## TODO:
I do plan to move all development from `gulp` to `webpack`.  I'll do this *very* soon. Once I've done this I will implement
a way to watch and build.

## Any issues?
